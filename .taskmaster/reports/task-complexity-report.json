			"taskId": 5,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Item Management (CRUD) with Categories and SKU",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the 'Implement Item Management (CRUD) with Categories and SKU' task into smaller, actionable subtasks. Start with the database schema for `items` and `item_categories`. Then, detail the backend server actions and frontend UI components needed for managing categories first. After that, outline the steps for implementing the full CRUD functionality for items, including the form, list view, and integration with the category data. Ensure you account for SKU uniqueness validation.",
			"reasoning": "The task involves two distinct but related CRUD operations (for items and categories). This requires separate backend logic, UI components (e.g., a modal for category management, a form for items), and database schema design. The need for a unique SKU adds a layer of validation complexity on the backend."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 6,
			"taskTitle": "Develop Quote Creation Form",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 7,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand the 'Develop Quote Creation Form' task. Start with the required Supabase table schemas for `quotes` and `quote_items`. Then, detail the frontend implementation steps: create the main form component, implement the client selection `Autocomplete`, build the dynamic line-item component (with its own item `Autocomplete`, quantity, and price fields), and finally, add the logic for real-time total calculation and form submission to a new server action.",
			"reasoning": "The complexity lies in the frontend state management for a dynamic form with multiple line items. It requires fetching data for two separate autocompletes, handling an array of items within the form state, and implementing real-time calculations, all of which are prone to bugs if not structured carefully."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 7,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Quote List and Detail View",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the 'Implement Quote List and Detail View' task. First, define the backend server action for fetching a paginated and filterable list of quotes. Then, describe the creation of the frontend list page, including the Material-UI `Table` and the search/filter input components. After that, outline the backend action and frontend page for the quote detail view, ensuring it fetches and displays all related data like client and line items.",
			"reasoning": "The task requires building two distinct views (list and detail) and implementing server-side logic for data fetching. The server-side search and filtering add complexity, as it involves managing UI state, URL parameters, and constructing dynamic database queries."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 8,
			"taskTitle": "Enable Quote Editing and Deletion",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand the 'Enable Quote Editing and Deletion' task. Start by defining the Supabase RLS policies for update and delete operations on quotes, differentiating between user roles. Then, detail the frontend work: adding 'Edit' and 'Delete' buttons to the detail page. Describe the implementation of the delete confirmation modal and its corresponding server action. Finally, outline the process for adapting the quote creation form into an edit form, including fetching existing data and handling the update submission.",
			"reasoning": "The task's complexity comes from two main areas: reusing and pre-populating the complex quote creation form for editing, and correctly implementing and testing the role-based Row Level Security policies. Both require careful implementation to ensure data integrity and security."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 9,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Quote Approval Workflow",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the 'Implement Quote Approval Workflow' task. Start with the database migration to add a `status` column to the `quotes` table. Then, detail the backend server action for an admin to change a quote's status. Outline the frontend changes on the quote detail page to display the status and show 'Approve'/'Reject' buttons for admins. Finally, describe how to enforce the rule that approved quotes cannot be edited, both in the UI and with RLS policies.",
			"reasoning": "This task involves a database schema change, new backend actions, and significant conditional logic on the frontend. The complexity lies in ensuring the workflow rules (e.g., who can change status, when editing is disabled) are enforced consistently across the UI, backend actions, and database RLS policies."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 10,
			"taskTitle": "Implement PDF Export for Quotes",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand the 'Implement PDF Export for Quotes' task, assuming a server-side generation approach. Detail the steps to create a Vercel Serverless Function that accepts a quote ID. Describe how this function will fetch the quote data, use a library like `jspdf` or `puppeteer` to construct a professionally formatted PDF with a logo, client details, and an itemized table. Finally, outline the frontend work to add a download button that calls this function and handles the response.",
			"reasoning": "PDF generation is a specialized task. Achieving a 'professionally formatted' result with dynamic data is complex. The server-side approach, while more robust, introduces the complexity of managing a serverless function, fetching all related data, and handling layout for a non-HTML medium."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 11,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Project Management Feature",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the 'Implement Project Management Feature' task. Start with the database schema for the new `projects` table and the modification to the `quotes` table. Then, outline the full CRUD implementation for projects (backend actions and UI). After that, describe the changes needed in the quote creation/edit form to add a project selector. Finally, detail the creation of the project detail page, which should display project information and a list of its associated quotes.",
			"reasoning": "This task introduces a new core entity (`Project`) which requires its own full CRUD implementation. It also requires modifying an existing, complex feature (quote creation/editing) and creating a new composite view (project detail page with a list of quotes), making it a moderately complex undertaking."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 12,
			"taskTitle": "Develop Sales Status Report",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand the 'Develop Sales Status Report' task. First, design the backend server action that performs the necessary data aggregation on approved quotes (e.g., grouping by month, by client). Then, for the frontend, break down the implementation for each required visualization: a bar chart for monthly revenue, a pie/bar chart for created vs. approved quotes, and a table/chart for revenue by client. Use `recharts` for the implementation. Finally, add controls for date range filtering.",
			"reasoning": "The complexity is twofold: writing efficient backend aggregation queries to transform raw data into meaningful metrics, and correctly implementing a data visualization library on the frontend. Each chart represents a unique data transformation and UI component, and making them interactive adds another layer of difficulty."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 13,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Basic Notification System",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the 'Implement Basic Notification System' task. Start with the Supabase database work: define the `notifications` table schema and create a database trigger that populates this table when a quote's status changes. Then, outline the frontend implementation: set up a Supabase Realtime listener in a global component, manage notifications in a shared state, and build the UI for the notification bell icon, including the unread count and a dropdown list.",
			"reasoning": "This task requires working with asynchronous, real-time events, which is a different paradigm from standard request-response. It involves database-level programming (triggers/functions), client-side state management for real-time data, and building a persistent UI element (the notification bell) that lives in the main layout."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 14,
			"taskTitle": "Implement System Settings and Configuration",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand the 'Implement System Settings and Configuration' task. First, define the schema for the `system_settings` table in Supabase. Then, describe the implementation of the admin-only settings page, including the form UI. Detail the server actions required to fetch the current settings and to save any updates. Ensure you mention how to protect this page and its actions so they are only accessible by users with an 'admin' role.",
			"reasoning": "This is a straightforward CRUD operation on a single entity (`settings`). It involves a simple form and basic backend actions. The main consideration is access control (admin-only), which is a common pattern. It doesn't involve complex state management, dynamic UI, or external libraries."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 15,
			"taskTitle": "Ensure Responsive Design for Mobile Use",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the 'Ensure Responsive Design for Mobile Use' task. Create a checklist of all major pages and components that need review (e.g., Main Layout, Quote List, Quote Form, Client Management). For each area, propose a responsive strategy, such as converting the main navigation to a drawer, making data tables horizontally scrollable, or stacking form fields vertically. Outline a testing plan using browser developer tools to validate the changes across different breakpoints.",
			"reasoning": "This is a high-complexity task due to its broad scope. It's not about building one new thing, but about auditing and potentially refactoring every UI component in the application. Complex components like data tables and multi-field forms are particularly challenging to adapt for small screens, requiring careful design and implementation."

		{
			"taskId": 16,
			"taskTitle": "Fix Google OAuth Infinite Loading in AuthCallback",
			"complexityScore": 9,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the task 'Fix Google OAuth Infinite Loading in AuthCallback'. Start with an investigation phase to pinpoint the root cause, examining the `AuthCallback` component's logic and the Supabase RLS policies on the `profiles` table. Then, propose a multi-part solution: 1) Enhance the frontend component with robust error handling and a timeout. 2) Draft a SQL migration to correct the faulty RLS policies. 3) Define a comprehensive test plan to validate the fix for all user scenarios.",
			"reasoning": "The complexity is very high because it's a debugging task at the intersection of authentication, database security (RLS), and frontend state management. These issues are often hard to reproduce and require a deep understanding of the full stack, from the third-party OAuth flow down to the database security rules."
